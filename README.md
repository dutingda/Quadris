The Game of Quadris
In this project, your group will work together to produce the video game Quadris, which is a Latinization of the game Tetris.
A game of Quadris consists of a board, 11 columns wide and 15 rows high. Blocks consisting of four cells (tetrominoes) appear at the top of the screen, and you must drop them onto the board so as not to leave any gaps. Once an entire row has been filled, it disappears, and the blocks above move down by one unit.
Quadris differs from Tetris in one significant way: it is not real-time. You have as much time as you want to decide where to place a block.
The major components of the system are as in the quadris.pdf file in the folder
