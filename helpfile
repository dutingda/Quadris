Usage of the command interpreter. Command syntax:

  command = !! | definable

  definable = primitive | macro | macroDefinition | (rep)(definable) | partial

  primitive = left | right | down
            | clockwise | counterlcockwise
            | drop
            | levelup | leveldown
            | random | norandom fileName
            | sequence fileName
            | blockShape
            | restart
            | hint
            | help
            | disp

  blockShape = I | J | O | L | S | Z | T

  macroDefinition = def macroName definable...

where
  !! - Runs the previously successfully executed command
  macro - A string str is a valid macro if it was previously defined using the command
          "def str definable..."
  (rep)(definable) - Repeats the execution of a definable rep number of times
  partial - Partial beginning of a string. Command interpreter executes command as soon as an unique
            definable starting with the same sequence of characters is found

For primitive commands:
  left, right, down - Moves current block in corresponding direction 1 unit
  clockwise, counterclockwise - Rotates current block in the corresponding direction
  drop - Drops the current block
  levelup, leveldown - Increases/decreases difficulty
  blockShape - Changes the shape of the current block to the one specified in the command
  random - Enables randomisation for levels 3 and 4. Enabled by default
  norandom fileName - Disables randomisation for levels 3 and 4. Loads blocks from fileName as specified
  sequence fileName - Executes sequence of commands found in fileName
  restart - Clears current score and board. Restarts game
  hint - Obtains a hint that the user can place the block. Hint algorithm: generate a location where
         placing the current block would result in the minimum overall height.
  help - Shows this help message
  disp - Prints the current board.
